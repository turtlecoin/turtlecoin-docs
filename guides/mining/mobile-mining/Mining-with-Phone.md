# Mining with Your Mobile Phone

### Please note: Using your mobile to mine TurtleCoin is not effective and should only be done for the lulz. It may also cause the phone to overheat and result in premature silicon degradation, shortening the lifespan of your phone.

*Currently only available on Android version 4.1(Jelly Bean, year 2012) and newer*

To mine TurtleCoin on your mobile phone, you can use either of these two apps(Tony Monero is recommended, however):

1. [Tony Monero](Using-Tony-Monero)
2. [AA Miner](Using-AA-Miner)
3. [Xmrig on Termux](Using-Termux)
