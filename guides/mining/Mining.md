## How to Mine TurtleCoin?<a name="how-to-mine"></a>

**Please note:** Unfortunately because of some bad people using mining software in malware, most antivirus software will detect the programs below as unsafe.

It is **likely** you will need to add exceptions and exclusions to your antivirus software in order to make things work properly.

Unless you know what you are doing, please ***only*** download from the links below.

There are currently a few different ways in which you can start mining TurtleCoin:

### 1. [XMR-Stak](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak)

XMR-Stak is a unified miner, which means the same program will be used to mine with both your CPU and your GPU. It will automatically detect your hardware and adjust the settings accordingly.

Please follow [this guide](XMR-Stak-Guide) to start mining TurtleCoin with XMR-Stak.

If you're on Linux, check [this guide](XMR-Stak-Linux-Guide).

### 2. [XMRig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig)

XMRig is a little bit different to XMR-Stak, you need to download a CPU and GPU miner separately and run two separate instances in your computer. One will use your CPU and the other one will use your GPU.

Please follow [this guide](XMRig-Guide) to start mining TurtleCoin with XMRig.

### 3. Cloud Mining

### 4. SBC/Raspberry Pi Mining
