# RainBorg? Wat Dat?

Back in the day, we had the [#raindance bot](Participating-in-Raindance), then people took advantage of the bot and it was retired. Now we have RainBorg!

This bot monitors chat activity. Once a certain criterion is met, RainBorg sends out a tip using the tipbot, [trtlbot++](Using-trtlbot-plus-plus), to people who have recently been chatting away.

## Criteria to Get Tips

There is a tipping window _(min time/max time)_ and chatting is monitored during that window. 

Those that "chat" during that time qualify and get added to a tip-list. 

Once the list of people to be tipped reaches a threshold, and the timer has met its criteria, all the tips are issued to those on that list, woohoo!  

To avoid the system being taken advantage of, some specifics will be kept unknown to the public; only the bot operator and Ninjas will know how the bot's gears turn. 

Simply participate in the chat and let RainBorg take care of the details, she knows what she's doing!

## Why Does this Exist?

Because it is fun and promotes an active community; it is another way that this project is different.

## Where Do the TRTLs Come From?

They come from all the generous people in the community. There is a pool of TRTL, the pool is filled up by anyone that wants to contribute. You could be a contributor! It is anonymous and 100% philanthropic. 

The only way it stops being anonymous is if you post in chat and disclose your donation.. `ha, I just sent 350K TRTL to the RainBorg, megatip time yo!`

## How to Get Rained On

To get started, simply register your wallet with [trtlbot++](Using-trtlbot-plus-plus#registering-your-wallet).

Go to `#wallets` in the Discord server and type

`.registerwallet <walletaddress>`

For example, you would type:

`.registerwallet TRTLv3pFrFm2yk4cYNtKf5fxV1b594tNrZfEV2CYWJsTSqr9BWoWMrUNpQaeD9StrzQrxpRQKPCdd1FfvT6D6dAg4pY6iB7sqsG`

That's it, you're in, now start chatting with your fellow turtles.

## How to Contribute to RainBorg

Send TRTL to this address

`TRTLv12WtKJAzTNtxSkbcXf7mjeVApSqRYACtoJE2X52UBSce7qGAQ1JQgG3MmArnZSbkJXKqBXiPX2Mno7xD4tqD3p8SySoBc5`

With this Payment ID **!! IMPORTANT !!**

`bca975edfe710a64337beb1685f32ab900989aa9767946efd8537f09db594bbd`

_No Payment ID equals a tip for the tipbot operator, it will not be donated to RainBorg._

## Channels in Which this Works

The tips are sent out to participants in these channels.

  * \#general _(more tips sent here as this is the main channel)_
  * \#help _(everyone appreciates being helped, lend a hand, get some tips!)_
  * \#mining _(the miners are important, let's tip them as well)_
  * \#dev_general _(these guys, amiright!?)_
  * \#dev_marketing *(spread the word!)* 

Other channels might be added, will update if that is the case.

## So if I don't chat, I don't get TRTL?

Pretty much.  
* The active chatters get rained on.  
  * The inactive chatters don't.  
    * It's simple.  

### I was active 2 minutes ago, and then everyone else got rained on but I didn't?

Well, let's break this down then. You WERE active _(past tense)_, and the other people who ARE active got the rain and you didn't because of the way the chatting window works.  

They were active during the time RainBorg was raining down on the active Turtles. 

Active Turtles win, that's the game. Be a good active Turtle and she will share her tips with you!

## So if I spam I get TRTL? What's the blacklist?!

This is not how it works or why it was set up... Gaming the system or attempting to game the system could land you on the exile list.  

People on the blacklist never get added to the tip list. Focus on being an engaged member of the community and let the tip mistress, RainBorg, handle raining tips on the people, she is most capable.  

There is a way to get unsolicited tips though, [be a good Turtle](https://medium.com/@turtlecoin/how-to-be-a-good-turtle-20a427028a18) and check out the tipbot, [trtlbot++](Using-trtlbot-plus-plus).

# Commands

She responds to `$` commands, including-

  * `$help` - you get a DM with a list of commands from RainBorg
  * `$balance` - Check the bot's tip balance
  * `$donate` - Learn how you can donate to the tip pool
  * `$optout` - Opt out of receiving tips from the bot
  * `$optin` - Opt back into receiving tips from the bot

# Stats

Every time RainBorg rains down tips on chatty Turtles she'll post a message in the `#raindance` channel.
They look something like this:

<blockquote>
<strong>TUT TUT</strong>
<p>Huzzah, 500 TRTL just rained on 4 chatty turtles in #mining, they each got 125 TRTL!</p>

</blockquote>

# Anything not covered here?

Open a [new issue](https://github.com/turtlecoin/meta/issues/new?title=RainBorg+Question) or make some noise in `#help`.
Or, just join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/qyXqkuk) and ask some fellow turtles!

## Wow? Megatip wat?

An idea has been floated regarding a Megatip function. Basically, someone could purposely send a large chunk of TRTL and most of it would be sent out in the next wave of rain tips. 

If you want to see something like this, talk about it! ;)
