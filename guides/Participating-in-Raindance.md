A raindance happens when the TurtleBotRain wallet has accumulated 5,000 or more TRTL.

When TurtleBotRain posts in the #raindance channel, it means a raindance is about to begin!

When you see this message the raindance will begin soon.
Get your TRTL wallet address ready.

**Wait** and especially **don't click on any reactions or emotes yet. This will cause a disqualification!**

Wait for the “Quick, send me your wallet addresses!” message.
