# Making a TurtleCoin Wallet

There are multiple different types of wallets you can choose to use for TurtleCoin, paper wallets, CLI wallets, GUI wallets and Web Wallets.

We recommend making a paper wallet so that you can start receiving funds, and later import them into a GUI or CLI wallet.

## Paper Wallet

The main purpose of a paper wallet is to quickly create a wallet to start receiving funds.

**You will not be able to spend or send your funds to other people until you set up a CLI, GUI or Web Wallet.**

## Zedwallet (CLI Wallet)

The CLI Wallet, called zedwallet, is a multi-platform program (Win/Linux/Mac) that requires you to enter commands for it to work and you cannot use your mouse. However, it is currently the most stable and gets the newest updates first.

If you would like to use zedwallet, you can check out [this guide](Using-zedwallet).

## WalletShell (GUI Wallet)

WalletShell, is a wallet written in Javascript which handles all of your needs and also includes additional features such as an address book, light and dark mode, and an active list of public nodes.
