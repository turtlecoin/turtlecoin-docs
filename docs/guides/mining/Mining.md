title: Mining Intro
---

Mining is essentially the process of using your computer to help verify and secure a cryptocurrency network, in our case, it is the TurtleCoin network. By doing this, you will be rewarded with some TurtleCoin.

If you want to learn about cryptocurrencies, mining is a great place to start!

**Please note:** Unfortunately because of some bad people using mining software in malware, most antivirus software will detect the programs below as unsafe.

It is **likely** you will need to add exceptions and exclusions to your antivirus software in order to make things work properly.

Unless you know what you are doing, please ***only*** download from the links below.

There are currently a few different ways in which you can start mining TurtleCoin:

## Desktop Mining

### [XMR-Stak](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak)

XMR-Stak is a unified miner, which means the same program will be used to mine with both your CPU and your GPU. It will automatically detect your hardware and adjust the settings accordingly.

Please follow [this guide](XMR-Stak-Guide) to start mining TurtleCoin with XMR-Stak.

If you're on Linux, check [this guide](XMR-Stak-Linux-Guide).

### [XMRig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig)

XMRig is a little bit different to XMR-Stak, you need to download a CPU and GPU miner separately and run two separate instances in your computer. One will use your CPU and the other one will use your GPU.

Please follow [this guide](XMRIG-Guide) to start mining TurtleCoin with XMRig.

### Solo Mining

Solo Mining is where you, alone, try to solve a block. It is extremely difficult and not recommended. If you'd like to give it a hand regardless see [this guide](CPU-Solo-Mining)

## SBC/Raspberry Pi Mining

Please follow [this guide](Mining-with-SBC) to mine with a SBC/Rasperry Pi.

## Mobile Mining

**Please note:** Using your mobile to mine TurtleCoin is not effective and should only be done for the lulz. It may also cause the phone to overheat and result in premature silicon degradation, shortening the lifespan of your phone.    

### Android

#### [Termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&hl=en_US)

Termux is a mobile CLI app; if you want to use it, you will have to download and compile XMRig on your phone (covered in the guide).
It is NOT a GUI app, and you will need to manually type/paste in commands

If you'd like to use it, check out [this guide](Using-Termux)

### iOS

#### [Crypto Miner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crypto-miner-for-monero-xmr/id1320235885?mt=8)
